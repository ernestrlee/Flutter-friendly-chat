# Friendly Chat

Friendly Chat is a Flutter UI exercise from a Google code lab.
This exercise demonstrates the use of widgets to build UI components
using flutter.  The app is composed of a listview, textfield, and a button.

The app uses state to control some of the UI components, such as
disabling the send button if there is text in the textfield.

The app also uses themes to control the look and feel of the app as well as
to display device specific UI for either iOS or Android.

Note: This is not a functional app.
